                <h1>Radiation poster:</h1>
                <p>Bring a bold, industrial edge to your room with the Radiation Warning Poster, inspired by classic nuclear hazard signage and retro–futuristic design. This poster captures the iconic black-and-yellow radiation symbol, reimagined with modern textures, subtle grunge effects, and a high-contrast finish that stands out in any space.
Perfect for fans of dystopian aesthetics, science-themed décor, or collectors of unique graphic art, this piece adds an instant statement to your wall. Printed with ultra-sharp detail on premium matte paper, it delivers museum-grade color accuracy and long-lasting durability.
Whether you’re decorating a studio, gaming room, or creative workspace, the Radiation Warning Poster blends style with attitude — a striking reminder of power, danger, and the glowing energy behind the Nuclear album’s world.</p>
<h1>"Nuclear" album</h1>
<p>Nuclear is a high-voltage blend of modern pop, neon nostalgia, and emotional intensity. Across ten electrifying tracks, the album explores the energy that lives between connection and collapse — the way love, memory, and longing can feel radioactive in all the best and worst ways.
From the glowing pulse of “Electric Heartbeat” to the dreamy warmth of “Neon Paradise,” each song builds a cinematic world filled with color, static, and late-night emotion. The album balances upbeat, dance-driven production with intimate lyrics, creating a sound that feels both futuristic and deeply human.
Designed as a concept project, Nuclear follows a loose narrative: a journey through summer nights, fading sparks, runaway feelings, and the glowing afterimage of relationships that changed everything. It’s vibrant, atmospheric, and instantly addictive — a perfect match for fans of retro-synth textures, modern pop hooks, and immersive storytelling.
Whether you’re discovering the band for the first time or expanding your collection, Nuclear delivers a powerful experience that lingers long after the final track fades.

<h1>"Afterglow" album</h1>
<p>Afterglow is a dark, atmospheric phonk experience shaped by midnight streets, distant headlights, and the echo of memories that refuse to fade. Built on heavy bass, dusty Memphis samples, and hypnotic chopped-vocal hooks, the album captures the intoxicating mix of nostalgia and adrenaline that defines modern phonk culture.
Across the project, gritty drums collide with dreamy synth pads, creating a sound that feels both haunting and cinematic. Tracks drift between slow-burn melancholy and high-octane energy, evoking the feeling of cruising through an empty city long after the world has gone quiet.
Afterglow explores themes of reflection, loneliness, late-night motion, and the glow left behind by moments you can’t let go of. It’s raw, immersive, and emotionally charged — perfect for listeners who crave phonk that hits hard but still carries depth and atmosphere.
Whether pumped through headphones or blasting in a car at 2 A.M., Afterglow delivers a powerful, unforgettable vibe from start to finish.</p>
